# Data Engineering Zoomcamp

This repository contains the notes and source code for the Data Engineering Zoomcamp that is hosted by [DataTalks.club](https://datatalks.club/).

## Week 2

Goal for week 2 is to cover the topics of Data Lake, getting an introduction to Workflow orchestration with Airflow, setting it up locally and then ingesting data to GCP and locally to PostgreSQL using Airflow DAGs. Finally, we'll also go over how to move files from AWS to GCP using Transfer Service.
